Architecture
•	Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
•	Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
The types of frontend development I used for my full stack project was HTML, express, plain JavaScript, and spa. The server assembles the HTML and sends complete pages. This was great because it was simple routing and minimal client JS needed. The downside to this is more full-page reloads, less fluid interactivity, tighter coupling between view, and server. For JavaScript it adds interactivity to server-rendered pages. It is lightweight and has low bundle size. The downsize is that complexity grows quickly as features pile up. And for single page application the the browser bootstraps a JS app, then fetches JSON from the API and updates views without page reloads. The upsides to this are that it is fast and has app-like UX. It has clear separation of concerns (API vs UI) and reusable components and client-side routing.
The reason the backend didn’t use NoSQL MongoDB database is that we used MongoDB instead because trip data is naturally document-shaped and Mongo’s flexible schemas make evolution/iteration easy, and its BSON/JSON model lines up cleanly with Node/Express and Mongoose. 
Functionality
•	How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
•	Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
JSON is different from JavaScript because JSON is a data interchange format strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects with no functions or methods. JavaScript is a programming language that manipulates that data. JSON ties the frontend and backend together as the contract and the server exposes trips as JSON and the Angular SPA consumes that JSON to populate components and forms. 
Instances that was used was that I moved HTTP calls into a dedicated TripData and switched template-driven forms to reactive forms in both Add and Edit screens, and extracted a reusable TripCard component to render consistent cards and centralize image-path logic. These refactors improved testability and services are easy to mock, also reduced duplication in a single card template and styles, and made it simpler to change validation rules in one place.
Testing
•	Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
I tested endpoints with POSTMAN and curl to isolate server behavior and I  created a trip with application/x-www-form-urlencoded, updated via PUT /api/trips/:tripCode. Then I validated the SPA integration by wiring the service calls and asserting that forms showed server validation feedback. I hit a few errors along the way such as 404 errors. Mongoose validation failures when required fields were missing, a date cast error that I fixed by normalizing the HTML date input to yyyy-MM-dd. Also missing Angular imports that broke *ngIf and formGroup and I fixed by adding CommonModule and ReactiveFormsModule, a missing route for edit-trip, and image path 404s that I solved by a helper that detects absolute URLs, Express /images, or Angular assets. On security, I enabled CORS only for the Angular origin and used content-type checks, and designed the API with clear resource paths and methods such as idempotent GET/PUT, side-effect POST/DELETE.
Reflection
•	How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
It has helped me reach my goals by modeling data in MongoDB with Mongoose, designing and testing REST endpoints, and building a maintainable SPA with Angular components, routing, and reactive forms. This will all helped me if I look for jobs in full stack. I developed my skills in practical debugging skills in reading stack traces, narrowing problems with Postman/curl, and tracing errors from the template back to missing imports or services. I also leveled up on code organization services, reusable components, form abstractions, and API/SPA contracts using JSON, and deployment-minded concerns like CORS and error handling. These skills make me more marketable for roles that expect me to deliver a coherent, testable admin experience on top of a Node/Express API, and to diagnose the kinds of integration issues that always appear in real projects.
